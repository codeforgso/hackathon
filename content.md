## About
The Code for Greensboro Fall Hackathon is a chance for developers, designers and technologists to team up under one roof and work together on a wide range of projects—many of which seek to directly improve life here in Greensboro and the Triad. This time, we'll be kicking off with speakers and dinner at HQ Greensboro—then moving to The Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering.

  <h4>
    Code for Greensboro Fall Hackathon 2015 Rules:
  </h4>

  <hr>

  <ul>
    <li>In the spirit of collaboration, form a team of at least two hackers. You may begin hacking at the conclusion of the Friday night social, November 6th at 9:00pm, and continue until we call time on Sunday, November 8th. App presentations for the competition will take place Sunday, November 8th. At least one team member must be present on Sunday to present your app in order to be considered.</li>
    </br>
    <li>App idea must have a civic focus. Special consideration will be given to apps focused on our Greensboro community. Suggested themes: health, resources, safety and justice, transportation, education, mapping, housing, and food/nutrition.</li>
    </br>
    <li>App must be open sourced, and utilize open data. We will unveil a set of civic open datasets at the Friday night social on November 6th. You may use any open data in your app, although special consideration will be given to teams that utilize one or more of the datasets unveiled at the social. A link to the datasets will be posted here at 9:00pm on November 6th.</li>
    </br>
    <li>It is not necessary to have a fully working and polished application at the end of the hackathon to be considered for the competition. Judges will be considering the spirit of your team's application and potential benifit to the community when selecting winning teams.</li>
    </br>
    <li>App idea must keep in line with the <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/">Code for America Principles for 21st Century Government.</a></li>
    </br>

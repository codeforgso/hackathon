    <h4>Open Source All the Cities</h4>
    <p>Open source is not only transforming our software, but it's transforming our government. Learn about some of the open source applications and civic hacking occurring in the Triangle of North Carolina from the author of "The foundation for an open source city." Leave with ideas that you can take back to your city to start creating a better citizen experience.</p>

    <p>Topics covered will include policy and different applications deployed by the City of Raleigh as well as initiatives from the citizens side including CityCamp North Carolina and Code for America Brigade initiatives in the Triangle. Finally, we'll discuss the five elements of an open source city.</p>

    <h5>Shawn Gagné/Urban Offsets</h5>
    <h4>Efficient data collection for tree surveys</h4>
    <p>We are looking for ways to solve one of the largest problems affecting carbon offset projects: Inefficient data collection. Inefficient data collection increases the cost of generating carbon offsets by 50% and is the main hurdle to generating locally-sourced offsets in cities across America. Reducing this cost will significantly expand the viability of carbon offset projects and allow cities to generate new sources of revenue by planting and growing healthier trees.</p>
    <p>Our data collection tasks are repeatable and follow defined rules identified in the Climate Action Reserve's Improved Urban Forestry protocol. In this workshop, we will lay out our data collection pain points and evaluate solution paths for both the desktop and field data collection components.</p>

    <h4>The Coworking Movement</h4>
    <p>The Coworking Movement: Greensboro Edition focuses on the recent changes and growth in Greensboro's entrepreneurial ecosystem. Greensboro currently faces challenges in combating a stagnant economy, low-wage jobs and growing poverty rates – the growth of coworking and alternative workspaces aim to create new hope for the city. Small business is repeatedly referred to as “the driver of local economies.” Fostering an environment that supports and cultivates entrepreneurial ventures holds the potential to grow local jobs. The Coworking Movement also promotes core values of Openness, Sustainability, Accessibility, Community and Collaboration, all of which are growing demands (and necessities) in the current work-world. </p>

    <p>In 2005, TriMet and Google developed a General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS). This moment changed the way that transit data is communicated on a global scale. Since then improvements have been made to incorporate on-time arrivals and service announcements. If this were to be applied to other forms of transportation where do the possibilities end?</p>

    <h4>Open Badges</h4>
    <p>Many open source developers will already be familiar with digital badges, image files attached to events or accomplishments. Mozilla's Open Badges take this idea a step further, embedding detailed metadata into the image file, contributing to a sort of standards-based online portfolio for the badge owner, which can be verified by the issuer of the badge (like a reference letter or a recommendation, but machine-readable). Imagine if your college transcript contained not just course titles but some details of the actual assignments you completed, and how well you did on them. I will walk the audience through the process of earning their first Open Badges, and then together we'll brainstorm potential applications of Open Badges here in the Triad.</p>

Come see techniques that cutting edge for local governments and help answer the question - What is the best way to engage YOU?</p>

    <%=image_tag ('/images/Shawn.jpg'), class: "left" %>
    <h5>Shawn Gagné/Urban Offsets</h5>
    <h4>Efficient data collection for tree surveys</h4>
    <p>We are looking for ways to solve one of the largest problems affecting carbon offset projects: Inefficient data collection. Inefficient data collection increases the cost of generating carbon offsets by 50% and is the main hurdle to generating locally-sourced offsets in cities across America. Reducing this cost will significantly expand the viability of carbon offset projects and allow cities to generate new sources of revenue by planting and growing healthier trees.</p>
    <p>Our data collection tasks are repeatable and follow defined rules identified in the Climate Action Reserve's Improved Urban Forestry protocol. In this workshop, we will lay out our data collection pain points and evaluate solution paths for both the desktop and field data collection components.</p>
